# Generate NFT images

## install

It is recommended to use [miniconda](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/miniconda/) to manage the environment. After installing miniconda, run the following command to generate the environment and run it

1. `conda create --name generate python=3.9 pillow pandas httpx`
2. `conda activate generate`
3. `pip install python-dotenv`
4. modify configs in `src/config.py`
5. run `python src/get_table.py`, this will generate a table called ratio.csv, you can modify probability of feature occurrence in the ratio column.
6. run `python src/generate.py` to generate images.
7. `python src/final_check.py`, remove the duplicates and view the current probability distribution, which can be adjusted again.
8. (can skip) `python src/upload_mystery_box.py` push mystery box metadata to IPFS
9. `python src/upload.py` push data to IPFS
